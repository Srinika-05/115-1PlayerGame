A Guide to Pair Programming
Welcome to the exciting world of pair programming! This is a fantastic way to write code, learn from your partner, and catch mistakes early. This guide will help you understand the core concepts of the Driver and Navigator roles, and how to use GitHub to collaborate effectively.

1. Setting Up Your Project
The first step is to get your project set up so both you and your partner can work on it. The key here is to use GitHub as your central hub.

Person 1 (The Creator):

Create the Repository: On GitHub, create a new public repository for your project. Give it a clear name, like calculator-project or space-invaders-game.

Get the Files: On your new repository's page, click the green Code button. You can either download the empty repository as a ZIP file or open it with GitHub Desktop to clone it to your computer.

Add Your Initial Files: Create your initial project files (e.g., .aia, index.html, script.js, style.css).

Commit and Push: After you've added your files, use a program like GitHub Desktop to commit your changes with a message like "Initial project setup" and then push them to GitHub. This makes the project available online.

Invite Your Partner: Go to the repository settings on GitHub and invite your partner as a collaborator. This gives them permission to push changes.

Person 2 (The Partner):

Get the Files: Once your partner has pushed the initial files, go to the repository page. Click the green Code button and either download the files as a ZIP or clone the repository to your computer using GitHub Desktop.

You're Ready! You now have the same project files on your computer and are ready to start programming.

2. The Roles: Driver and Navigator
Pair programming involves two distinct roles that you will switch between as you work. The most important rule is that you should switch roles frequently, typically every 15-20 minutes, or after completing a small feature.

The Driver
The Driver is the one with their hands on the keyboard. Their entire focus is on writing code and implementing the current task.

Your focus as the Driver:

Be in the code. You are the one typing. Your job is to translate the ideas into actual code.

Talk it out. While you code, verbally explain what you are doing. This helps the Navigator understand your thought process.

Listen to the Navigator. Pay close attention to your partner's suggestions and questions. They are your second pair of eyes.

Commit Changes: After completing a small, self-contained feature or bug fix, you are responsible for saving and pushing your code. With a tool like GitHub Desktop, you'll be able to stage your changes, write a clear commit message, and then push to the main branch.

The Navigator
The Navigator is the one with their computer set up with the project documentation. Their job is to guide the Driver, catch mistakes, and think about the big picture.

Your focus as the Navigator:

Big Picture Thinking: You are the strategist. Think about what needs to be done next, how the code fits together, and potential problems down the line.

Documentation is Your Guide: Keep the project's requirements, documentation, and any relevant examples open on your screen. You should be constantly referencing these.

Don't Touch the Keyboard. Your computer is for reading, not coding. This ensures the Driver stays focused on writing code.

Spot Bugs: Look for typos, syntax errors, and logical flaws as the Driver types.

Suggest and Ask Questions: Guide your partner with questions like, "What if we use a loop here instead?" or suggestions like, "The documentation says to use the document.getElementById function."

3. The Collaboration Cycle
The magic of pair programming happens in the constant communication and role-switching.

Discuss: Before you start a new task, talk about it. Decide what you're going to build and how you'll approach it.

Driver Codes, Navigator Guides: The Driver begins to code while the Navigator watches, suggests, and references documentation.

Commit: Once the small task is complete, the Driver commits the changes and pushes them to GitHub.

Pull and Switch: Now, it's the other person's turn to be the Driver. The new Driver must first pull the latest changes from GitHub to their machine. This is also called "fetching" or "syncing" and a program like GitHub Desktop will have a button to do this. This gets the work your partner just finished.

Repeat: You now repeat the cycle with the new roles.

By following this guide, you will not only write better code but also learn to be a better collaborator and problem-solver.
